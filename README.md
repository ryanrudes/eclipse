# What is this?
In a panic that arose about two weeks before the April 8th total solar eclipse, I realized I still had no working flight plan to get to the line of totality. By that point, flights were so limited that it was nearly impossible to find anything useful by hand. So, I quickly threw together this codebase to search for ideal flight plans.

# Running
First, install the required dependencies
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, run `search.py` to search for flight plans
```
python search.py
```
